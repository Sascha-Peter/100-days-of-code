# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
* Creation of the base project and default files which are required
* Adding the dynamic secret key generation (inspired by OpenShift)

**Thoughts:** 
The set up of the template project will increase the speed in which I'll be able
to deliver django projects in the future and help out with the other pet projects
I'll be tackling during those 100 days.

### Day 2: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
* Creation of base template files (base, nav, footer)
* Added base authentication system with url overwrite to prettify the urls
* Added bootstrap support

**Thoughts:** 
With the base html templates in place and bootstrap added in, I'll be easily able
to create new base templates with ease and have the relevant building blocks in place
to get going from the beginning.

Using django's own authentication system will save me hassle and stress with writing my
own and the prettification of the urls for password reset go well along with the rest
of the url structure I have in mind or my future pet projects.
