# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
* Creation of the base project and default files which are required
* Adding the dynamic secret key generation (inspired by OpenShift)

**Thoughts:** 
The set up of the template project will increase the speed in which I'll be able
to deliver django projects in the future and help out with the other pet projects
I'll be tackling during those 100 days.
