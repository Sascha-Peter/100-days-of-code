# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
* Creation of the base project and default files which are required
* Adding the dynamic secret key generation (inspired by OpenShift)

**Thoughts:** 
The set up of the template project will increase the speed in which I'll be able
to deliver django projects in the future and help out with the other pet projects
I'll be tackling during those 100 days.

### Day 2: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
* Creation of base template files (base, nav, footer)
* Added base authentication system with url overwrite to prettify the urls
* Added bootstrap support

**Thoughts:** 
With the base html templates in place and bootstrap added in, I'll be easily able
to create new base templates with ease and have the relevant building blocks in place
to get going from the beginning.

Using django's own authentication system will save me hassle and stress with writing my
own and the prettification of the urls for password reset go well along with the rest
of the url structure I have in mind or my future pet projects.

### Day 3: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
* Creation of cookiecutter template
* Adjustment of the project to make use of the cookiecutter parameters

**Thoughts:** 
I've heard about cookiecutter ages ago but didn't use it myself. Now as I've re-discovered it
and confirmed that I'm about as smarty pants as a few thousand developers who already done an
impressive and comprehensive django-template for cookie cutter, I'm even more happy about finishing
this project :D I'll re-invent the wheel but for my own needs. I might actually do a cookiecutter
django template for OpenShift, which is quite a bit different from a regular django setup. We will see.

### Day 4: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
* Change cookie cutter project structure

**Thoughts:** 
There's been a few issues around the cookie cutter usage which made me look into some of the 
example cookie cutter templates other people have been doing and I've found that there was an issue
with my folder structure. I'm still debugging it as I've not completely resolved it but hope to get that
done in the next session.

### Day 5: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
* Adjusted the django templates not to contain conflicting jinja2 syntax
* Set correct paths in the settings file
* Made the cookiecutter template work

**Thoughts:** 
Jinja2 is a pain in the butt and I'd refrain from using it in conjunction with django projects. 
Unfortunately, cookiecutter installs jinja2 as it uses it itself. I'm sure there is a way around
but it's quite late and I'm too tired to look into that now - also spend the time I allocated for
the project today already.
